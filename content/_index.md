Welcome to my academic website! I am a political science researcher with interests in political behavior, public opinion, and experimental methods.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on understanding how political attitudes and behaviors develop and change over time. I use experimental methods and survey data to study topics including:

- Political polarization and partisanship
- Online dating and political preferences  
- Public opinion formation
- Experimental political science

## Current Projects

I am currently working on several projects examining how political preferences influence personal decisions and social interactions, particularly in online contexts.
