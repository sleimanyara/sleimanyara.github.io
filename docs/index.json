While classic accounts see such pressures as demobilizing, recent work suggests they encourage deliberation by exposing citizens to diverse viewpoints. I argue that group-based cross-pressures primarily reshape how citizens decide. Using panel data analysis and a novel dynamic conjoint experiment in the US that traces electoral decision-making in real time, I show that group cross-pressures weaken policy-congruent (“correct”) voting by discouraging information-seeking and pushing voters to anchor their choices on a single salient issue. This challenges the normative view that holding conflicted attitudes improves the quality of participation and suggests that cross-pressures constrain deliberation and weaken the representational signal voters send to parties.\n","date":1755216e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1755216e3,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"2022-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"My name is Yara and I am a final-year PhD candidate in Political Science at the Queen Mary University of London, supervised by Prof. Maria Grasso.

A key aspect of this question concerns the extent to which partisan biases stem from out-group animus or assumptions about associated traits. To address this question, we focus on online dating to identify factors that mitigate these biases. Through a conjoint experiment with 3,000 UK participants, we disentangle the influence of partisanship from political and non-political confounding factors. We show that partisanship and physical appearance equally influence dating decisions. At the same time though, political tolerance has a significantly stronger effect. Our results also indicate important asymmetries in preferences among partisans. While both exhibit an in-party bias, Labour supporters were roughly twice as likely to choose co-partisan dates compared to Conservatives. Counter-stereotypic traits mitigate partisan biases among Conservatives but exacerbate them among Labour supporters. The overarching theme discerned is clear while partisanship undoubtedly holds sway in the dating realm, other factors — many previously overlooked or under-emphasized — can meaningfully mediate its influence.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"‘Sleeping With the Enemy’: Partisan Sorting in Online Dating","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1738368e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1738368e3,"objectID":"ab7b4135514e7bd45dc215c40f2907db","permalink":"https://sleimanyara.github.io/teaching/methods/","publishdate":"2025-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/methods/","section":"teaching","summary":"B.Sc. in Politics - Queen Mary University London","tags":null,"title":"Political Science Methods","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1727740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727740800,"objectID":"1874406cdf4bb18d249c69fd210505c3","permalink":"https://sleimanyara.github.io/teaching/comparative/","publishdate":"2024-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/comparative/","section":"teaching","summary":"M.Sc. in Politics - Queen Mary University London","tags":null,"title":"Comparative Politics","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Yara Sleiman","Maria Grasso","Charles Pattie","Carlo Hofer","Laura Serra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1715731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715731200,"objectID":"e5a6ef84b0f73f9295b24d59e4f6d859","permalink":"https://sleimanyara.github.io/wp/humour/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/wp/humour/","section":"wp","summary":"How does political humour influence affective partisan polarisation? In today’s media landscape, humour is increasingly used to ridicule opposing factions, potentially deepening political divides. At the same time, humour can mitigate polarisation by evoking positive emotions and diffusing tensions. Thus far, it remains unclear whether inter-group political humour, as a medium of expression, uniquely impacts polarisation separately from political content more generally. To address this question, we conducted a pre-registered survey experiment in Great Britain (n=2011), employing a 2x3 factorial design that varies both the tone (humorous vs. non-humorous) and target (in-group, out-group, or neutral) of political messages. We find that messages targeting in-partisans increase polarisation. However, when these messages are delivered humorously, the effect is reversed, resulting in a significant decrease in polarisation. Notably, humour moderates the impact of in-group targeted messages on polarisation by reducing both out-group hostility and in-group favouritism. The depolarising effect of humour is attributed to changes in content perception and the reduction of negative emotional responses.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Polarising punchlines: The influence of inter-group humour on partisan affective polarisation","type":"wp"},{"authors":["Yara Sleiman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1715731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715731200,"objectID":"9ed4c22510583cf1d3ffd2777105ae61","permalink":"https://sleimanyara.github.io/publication/blast/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blast/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Rallying ‘round a failed state: Institutional trust in post-blast Beirut","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

While extensive research has been conducted on the effects of informality on the economy, the empirical evidence about which employees enter the informal labour market remains mixed. This study elicits labour preferences for informal work arrangements in Lebanon, a country grappling with severe economic instability. Drawing on qualitative insights, we operationalise informality in the Lebanese labour market and administer an in-the-field choice experiment to elicit job preferences (N=1450) in two Lebanese cities. Our findings show that employees prefer job choices that offer social protection and private insurance but avoid formal contracts.Using an unsupervised clustering technique, we sort informal workers into distinct skill-based groups and show that high-skilled workers self-sort in informality to avoid social security and contracts in an unstable environment. Implications with regard to tax and social security legislation are discussed.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Who Needs Security in a Crisis?
